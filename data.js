const largeInfo = `Welcome to my portfolio site, I to want first thank you for taking an into intrest in me and my website.
Secondly I would like to note that everything in this website you see or interact with is created by yours truly. 
I began messing around with computer hardware and software at a young age. Later as I grew so did my intrest into the field of IT.
From building my own computer to creating video game assets such as 3D models and scripts. <br> <br>

The result is that over the years I have accumulated a wide skillset that enables me to rapidly create prototypes of games, 
applications and websites. Since I can master both the visual and programming side of things, the question I will pose to you is this;
Why hire one person for each job, why not hire one jack of all trades instead?`
